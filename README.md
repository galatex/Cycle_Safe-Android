# Cycle_Safe-Android

This project was created during a hackathon with Microsoft. 1st place.
The functionality of this app is to provide navigation for bike riders.
The app will take public data released by the city of Austin to provide
a safe route away from high crime rate and accident prone areas. Also, based
on other cyclist it will determine the flow of traffic in that area, so it will
remap the faster routes, similiar to how the mapping system works for cars. If integrated with
Google Maps it will safe the time it would take to get users to download a separate app, as well as
the data for traffic would be more accurate as well as in cordination with Google Maps for drivers.
Terrain data could also be included to provide a level of difficulty meter.
